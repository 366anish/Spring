= Cache Abstraction

Since version 3.1, the Spring Framework provides support for transparently adding caching to
an existing Spring application. Similar to the <<data-access.adoc#transaction, transaction>>
support, the caching abstraction allows consistent use of various caching solutions with
minimal impact on the code.

In Spring Framework 4.1, the cache abstraction was significantly extended with support
for <<cache-jsr-107,JSR-107 annotations>> and more customization options.
