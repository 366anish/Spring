The MVC Java configuration and the MVC XML namespace provide default configuration
suitable for most applications and a configuration API to customize it.

For more advanced customizations, which are not available in the configuration API,
see <<mvc-config-advanced-java>> and <<mvc-config-advanced-xml>>.

You do not need to understand the underlying beans created by the MVC Java configuration
and the MVC namespace. If you want to learn more, see <<mvc-servlet-special-bean-types>>
and <<mvc-servlet-config>>.
